# third-year-course

## Relational databases (weeks 9-10)
Three common options for storage are text files, spreadsheets, and databases. Text files are easiest to create, and work well with version control, but then we would have to build search and analysis tools ourselves. Spreadsheets are good for doing simple analyses, but they donâ€™t handle large or complex data sets well. Databases, however, include powerful tools for search and analysis, and can handle large, complex data sets. These lessons will show how to use an SQL database to explore balance sheet data for U.S. banks.

While SQL (and perhaps relational databases in general) are stll widely used in industry...

...the use of SQL databases declining relative to NoSQL databases is declinging rapidly.

My current plan is to cover NoSql databases in the 3rd year course. A solid understanding of SQL databases will help students understand when and why one should prefer SQL or NoSQL for a particular problem.
